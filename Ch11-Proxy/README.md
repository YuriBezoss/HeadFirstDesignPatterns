__ATTENTION__

Since there is no direct C++ support for the _remote_ and _protection proxies_ as they are shown in the book, they will not be implemented here. The same functionalities could be achieved through third party and/or manual implementation probably, but that is out of the scope of this translation project. The _virtual proxy_ on the other hand was implemented using Qt.

For a bit of additional reading on proxy classes in C++, here is a [stackoverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/994488/what-is-proxy-class-in-c) and a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern#C++).
