# Head First Design Patterns #
## A C++ translation ##

This repository contains a C++ translation of most of the Java code found in the great book [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58128.Head_First_Design_Patterns). What is presented here is of course not of production quality (neither was it intended by the original authors), but I tried to use most modern C++ techniques and coding styles (that I know of) to make this translation. Please also note that since C++ is not Java, I only followed the design presented in the book on a "on need" basis, so expect some dissimilarities between the original Java code and this, especially when graphical toolkits and file structuring were involved.

I also included _CMakeLists.txt_ files for every example to help interested people build and test my code right away. When using these however, please make sure that all necessary libraries and compatible compilers are installed, as I only provided checks for Qt and C++ standard versions.
Please also note that this code and builds were only tested on a Linux based system, so if you have problems on Windows or macOS, please let me know.

Finally, in case you find something missing or in need of correction, please don't hesitate to contact me, I'll be more than happy to accept any input.
